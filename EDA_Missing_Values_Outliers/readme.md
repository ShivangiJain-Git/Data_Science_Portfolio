# Exploratory Data Analysis - Outlier Treatment

- ### CONTEXT 
  The primary goal of EDA is to maximize the analyst's insight into a data set and into the underlying structure of a data set, while providing all of the specific items that an 
  analyst would want to extract from a data set, such as: a good-fitting, parsimonious model and other things like:
  - Ways of detecting missing values
  - Standard and non-standard missing values
  - Basic imputation methods for replacing missing values
  - Identifying and removing Duplicates from your data
  - Outlier detection - visually
  - Outlier detection - by Z-scores
  - Replacing outliers by median
  - Outlier detection - by IQR
  - Replacing outliers by whiskers
  - Remove or modify incorrect or unwanted observations
