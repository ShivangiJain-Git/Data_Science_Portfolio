- ### CONTEXT
  It is common for people who tend to think of their reality as a series of black and white events to suffer from depression. Psybersquare, Inc. describes a few 
  examples of this way of thinking by saying that those who suffer from this way of thinking think that, "If things aren't 'perfect,' then they must be "horrible." 
  If your child isn't "brilliant" then he must be 'stupid.' If you're not 'fascinating' then you must be 'boring.'" This can be a difficult way to live since those 
  suffering from this way of thinking may never feel that their reality is “good enough”. 

- ### OBJECTIVE 
  To determine if there is a relationship between higher levels of black and white thinking and higher levels of self-reported depression in psychiatric patients 
  hospitalized for depression.Also apply K means clustering and assign groups for model prediction
