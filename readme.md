- ### Major Projects 
	
	- [Applied Statistics: Analyzing customer information](https://github.com/ShivangiJain-Git/Major_Projects/tree/main/Applied_Statistics) : Analyzing dataset of customer information for an insurance company i.e various attributes of customers are crucial in making business decisions. Hence, knowing to explore and generate value out of such data can be an invaluable skill to have.
	- [Supervised Learning: Bank Loan Prediction](https://github.com/ShivangiJain-Git/Major_Projects/tree/main/Supervised_Learning) : Building various classification models to predict the likelihood of a liability customer buying personal loans.
	- [Ensemble Technique:Parkinson's Disease Prediction](https://github.com/ShivangiJain-Git/Major_Projects/tree/main/Ensemble_Technique) : Applying different ensemble techniques and supervised algorithms to classify the patients into the respective labels using the attributes from their voice recordings.
	- [Unsupervised Learning:Object Recognition](https://github.com/ShivangiJain-Git/Major_Projects/tree/main/Unsupervised_Learning ) : Analyzing features extracted from the silhouette of vehicles of different types and  to classify a given silhouette as one of three types of vehicle, using a set of features extracted from the silhouette. The vehicle may be viewed from one of many different angles to identify the type of it.
	- [Feature Model tuning: Cement Manufacturing](https://github.com/ShivangiJain-Git/Major_Projects/tree/main/Feature_tuning) : Fine tuning various ML algorithms hyperparameters and analyzing which gives the best result.
