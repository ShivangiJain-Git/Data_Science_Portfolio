- ### CONTEXT 
  We will use Logistic Regression to model the "Pima Indians Diabetes" data set.
  This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to
  diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints
  were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima
  Indian heritage.

- ###  OBJECTIVE
  This model will predict which people are likely to develop diabetes.
